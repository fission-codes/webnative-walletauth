Use the [Webnative SDK](https://github.com/fission-codes/webnative#readme) with a blockchain wallet. Access your personal encrypted file system with your wallet keys.

## Usage

Uses Ethereum by default with `window.ethereum` as the provider. Currently only works with MetaMask because it's the only wallet with encryption and decryption.

```ts
import * as walletauth from "webnative-walletauth"
import { AppScenario } from "webnative"

// Initialise

const program = await walletauth.program({
  // optional event handlers
  onAccountChange: (newProgram) => handleProgram(newProgram),
  onDisconnect: () => { /* eg. logout() */ }
})

handleProgram(program)

function handleProgram(program) {
  if (program.session) {
    // âœ… Authenticated
  } else {
    // Failed to authenticate with wallet
  }
}
```

Use a custom Ethereum provider:

```ts
import * as ethereum from "webnative-walletauth/wallet/ethereum"

ethereum.setProvider(window.ethereum)
```

**You can also write an implementation for other wallets.** Note that the DID method has to be supported by the [Fission server](https://github.com/fission-codes/fission), unless you're using something else with webnative. At the moment of writing, you can only use the `key` method for DIDs with the Fission servers. It supports ED25519, RSA and SECP256K1 keys, same for the UCAN algorithms.

```ts
import { Implementation } from "webnative-walletauth/wallet/implementation"

const impl: Implementation = {
  decrypt:              (encryptedMessage: Uint8Array) => Promise<Uint8Array>,
  did:                  () => Promise<string>,
  encrypt:              (data: Uint8Array) => Promise<Uint8Array>,
  init:                 () => Promise<void>,
  sign:                 (data: Uint8Array) => Promise<Uint8Array>,
  ucanAlgorithm:        string,
  username:             () => Promise<string>,
  verifySignedMessage:  (args: { signature: Uint8Array; message: Uint8Array; publicKey?: Uint8Array }) => Promise<boolean>,
}

// When creating a Program indicate that you want to use your custom wallet implementation.
walletauth.program({
  wallet: impl
})
```
